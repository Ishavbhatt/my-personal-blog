##  Redux

Redux is an open-source JavaScript library for managing application state. It is most commonly used with libraries such as React or Angular for building user interfaces. It is a library which holds the entire state of the app in the simplest manner possible while also using the least amount of boilerplate code. Redux helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. The Redux DevTools make it easy to trace when, where, why, and how your application's state changed. Redux works with any UI layer, and has a large ecosystem of addons to fit your needs.

Redux allows you to manage the state of the application via a unidirectional flow where a child component child component can directly access the state from the redux store instead of getting state changes from parent components.

### Important things that I should keep in mind while working in react or redux

1. Reducers must be pure functions. Given any input, output must always be the same.

2. The state of whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store. 

3. State is read-only. The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.
 
4. Changes in state are made with pure functions ( reducers).

### Actions:

Actions are payloads of information that send data from your application to your store. Action is an plain object that is returned by a pure function with no side-effects. The action object contains the “type” and any necessary information to update the state. The object is sent to the store using dispatch(), and the store updates the state using the information contained in the action object. Actions describe that something happened.

### Reducer:

Reducer is a pure function that takes the current state and action, and performs an update on the state. It returns the new state. Typically use a switch statement that reads the action.type and then creates the new state with this action which is still just a plain JavaScript. Reducers specify how the application's state changes in response to actions sent to the store.

### Store:

Redux doesn't have a Dispatcher or support many stores. Instead, there is just a single store with a single root reducing function There is only one and it holds the entire state in a single object. It is created by a variable using createStore(combinedReducer). The store passes two arguments to the reducer — the previous state and the action.

#### Flow:

1. A user interacts with a frontend component. A prop is used to call a function which initiates an action. Actions are initiated using props as they are mapped to props in an object called mapActionsToProps ( or it can be called anything), which tells the react app which props to be used to initiate an action.

2. An action usually contains a type (or identifier) and payload (or data). It can also perform tasks such as fetching data from APIs.

3. Once an action is dispatched, it is received by a reducer. A reducer’s job is to return the changed state. Depending on the type of the action, a reducer may return an altered state of the component.

4. The changed state is again utilized to show the updated component. The states are mapped to the props of the component, in the mapStateToProps function. The defined props in this function can be used accordingly to update the components.

5. The Redux store saves the complete state tree returned by the root reducer

6. The components are “subscribed” through the connect function and updated accordingly
